<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'>I heard
there was a secret chord<br>
that David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
but you don't really care for music do ya<br>
Well it goes like this the fourth the fifth<br>
the minor fall and the major lift<br>
the baffled king composing hallelujah<br>
<br>
Hallelujah..</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'><br>
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
you saw her bathing on the roof<br>
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
she tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
she broke your throne and she cut your hair<br>
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah.<br>
<br>
Hallelujah...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'><br>
Baby I've been here before<br>
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor<br>
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya<br>
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
and love is not a victory march<br>
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'>Hallelujah...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'>Well there
was a time when you let me know<br>
what's really going on below<br>
but now you never show that to me do ya<br>
but remember when I moved in you<br>
and the Holy dove was moving too<br>
and every breath we drew was hallelujah<br>
<br>
Hallelujah...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:105%'><br>
Well maybe there's a God above<br>
but all I've ever learned from love<br>
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya<br>
And it's not a cry that you hear at night<br>
it's not somebody who's seen the light<br>
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah<br>
<br>
Hallelujah...</span></p>
